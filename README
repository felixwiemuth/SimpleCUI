 Description
-------------

SimpleCUI is a C++ library that provides an automatic, character-based user interface.
Once included only an object of "Cui" has to be defined, commands with respective
methods to be passed and the "run()" method to be called.
Then your own program can be controlled by the user over SimpleCUI.
